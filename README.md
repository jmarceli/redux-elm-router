# redux-elm-router

Sample app which integrates [redux-elm](https://github.com/salsita/redux-elm) with [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux).

It contains two independent counters each one has it's own route. Current route can be changed by links at the top of the page.

This project now supports HMR, see commit `22b0262`.

## Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```
